<u><h1 id="what" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">What are Bees?</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Bees are winged insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their roles in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea.</p>

<u><h1 id="us" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">Why are Bees important to us?</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Bees have cultural and environmental importance as pollinators and producers of honey and medicinal products. The movement of pollen between plants is necessary for plants to fertilize and reproduce. Both farmed and wild bees control the growth and quality of vegetation, when they thrive, so do crops.</p>

<h6 style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:10px color:gray" title="Said by Einstein">Note that if bees did not exist humanity will come to a end in just 3 to 4 years!!</h6>

<u><h1 id="humans" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">Why will humans die without Bees?</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Without bees, the availability and diversity of fresh produce would decline substantially, and human nutrition would likely suffer. Crops that would not be cost-effective to hand- or robot-pollinate would likely be lost or persist only with the dedication of human hobbyists.</p>

<u><h1 id="wasp" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">What is the differnce between a Wasp and a Bee?</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Bees are typically rounder and fuzzier than wasps. They also have wider bodies and flattened hind legs used for carrying pollen. Wasps, on the other hand, are more slender with a narrow waist and smooth, shiny bodies. They also have longer legs compared to bees.</p>

<u><h1 id="queen" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">What is a Queen Bee?</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">A queen bee is typically an adult, mated female (gyne) that lives in a colony or hive of honey bees. With fully developed reproductive organs, the queen is usually the mother of most, if not all, of the bees in the beehive.Queens are developed from larvae selected by worker bees and specially fed in order to become sexually mature. There is normally only one adult, mated queen in a hive, in which case the bees will usually follow and fiercely protect her.</p>

<u><h1 id="royal" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">What is Royal Jelly?</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Unlike honey, royal jelly is naturally bitter and sour. Worker honey bees secrete the substance from their glands to feed their larvae and queens. Although that sounds gross, the flavor doesn't stop people from using royal jelly as a supplement to aid different health conditions.</p>

<u><h1 id="need" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">The need for bees</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">We need bees. We may take them and other pollinators like butterflies and hoverflies for granted, but they're vital to stable, healthy food supplies and key to the varied, colourful and nutritious diets we need (and have come to expect).</p>

<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Bees are perfectly adapted to pollinate, helping plants grow, breed and produce food. They do so by transferring pollen between flowering plants and therefore keeping the cycle of life turning.</p>

<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">The vast majority of plants we need for food rely on pollination, especially by bees: from almonds and vanilla to apples and squash. Bees also pollinate around 80% of wildflowers in Europe, so our countryside would be far less interesting and beautiful without them.</p>

<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">But bees are in trouble. There's growing public and political concern at bee decline across the world. This decline is caused by a combination of stresses, from loss of habitat and food sources to exposure to pesticides and the effects of climate breakdown.</p>

<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">More than ever before, we need to recognise the importance of bees to nature and to our lives. And we need to turn that into action to ensure they don't just survive but thrive.</p>

<u><h1 id="types" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">Types of bees</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Not all bees are the same. There are over 20,000 known species of bee globally. Around 270 species of bee have been recorded in the UK. Only 1 of these is the famous Honeybee.Most Honeybees are kept by beekeepers in colonies of managed hives. The rest of our bees are wild, including 25 bumblebee species and more than 220 types of solitary bee.Like Honeybees, the familiar Bumblebees live in social colonies - usually in holes in the ground or tree cavities.Solitary bees tend to nest on their own, as the name suggests. Each female builds and provisions her own nest with food. Solitary bees include Mining bees which nest in the ground, as well as Mason bees and Leafcutter bees that nest in holes in dead wood, banks and walls.</p>

<blockquote style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px color:orange">"More than 90% of the leading global crop types are visited by bees."</blockquote>

<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production, <abbr title="The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services">IPBES</abbr>. Bees gather pollen to stock their nests as food for their young. They have special features to collect it - like branched hairs called 'scopae' or combs of bristles called pollen baskets on their legs. As bees visit plants seeking food, pollen catches on their bodies and passes between plants, fertilising them , that's pollination.Bees are not the world's only pollinators. Flies, wasps, moths, beetles and even some birds, bats and lizards all pollinate, but they only visit flowers enough to feed themselves. Because they gather pollen to stock their nests, bees are generally the most effective pollinators since they visit many more flowers and carry more pollen between them.Some bee species are also specially developed to pollinate particular plants and without them those plants would be less well-pollinated.</p>

<u><h1 id="origin" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">The Origin of Bees</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Based on phylogenetic analysis, bees are thought to have originated during the Early Cretaceous (about 124 million years ago) on the supercontinent of West Gondwana, just prior to its breakup into South America and Africa. The supercontinent is thought to have been a largely xeric environment at this time; modern bee diversity hotspots are also in xeric and seasonal temperate environments, suggesting strong niche conservatism among bees ever since their origins.</p>

<u><h1 id="evolve" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">The Evolution of Bees</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px">Bees evolved from ancient predatory wasps that lived 120 million years ago. Like bees, these wasps built and defended their nests, and gathered food for their offspring. But while most bees feed on flowers, their wasp ancestors were carnivorous. They stung and paralyzed other insects, bringing them back to feed developing offspring in the nest.</p>

<u><h1 id="family" style="font-family:bahnschrift;">What are Bee Families</h1></u>
<p style="font-family:bahnschrift; font-size:20px"> Biologists classify all bee species into the Apidae, Halictidae, Megachilidae, Andrenidae, Colletidae, Melittidae, and Stenotritidae families. The largest family is Apidae which includes the bumblebee and honey bee.</p>

<ul>
  <li style="font-family:bahnschrift;"><strong>Apidae:</strong> Apidae is the largest family within the superfamily Apoidea, containing at least 5700 species of bees. The family includes some of the most commonly seen bees, including bumblebees and honey bees, but also includes stingless bees (also used for honey production), carpenter bees, orchid bees, cuckoo bees, and a number of other less widely known groups.</li>

  <li style="font-family:bahnschrift;"><strong>Megachilidae:</strong> Megachilidae is a cosmopolitan family of mostly solitary bees. Characteristic traits of this family are the restriction of their pollen-carrying structure (called a scopa) to the ventral surface of the abdomen (rather than mostly or exclusively on the hind legs as in other bee families), and their typically elongated labrum.</li>

  <li style="font-family:bahnschrift;"><strong>Halictidae:</strong> Halictidae is the second-largest family of bees (clade Anthophila) with nearly 4,500 species. They are commonly called sweat bees (especially the smaller species), as they are often attracted to perspiration.</li>

  <li style="font-family:bahnschrift;"><strong>Andrenidae:</strong> The Andrenidae (commonly known as mining bees) are a large, nearly cosmopolitan family of solitary, ground-nesting bees. Most of the family's diversity is located in temperate or arid areas (warm temperate xeric). It includes some enormous genera (e.g., Andrena with over 1300 species, and Perdita with over 700).</li>

  <li style="font-family:bahnschrift;"><strong>Colletidae:</strong> The Colletidae are a family of bees, and are often referred to collectively as plasterer bees or polyester bees, due to the method of smoothing the walls of their nest cells with secretions applied with their mouthparts; these secretions dry into a cellophane-like lining.</li>

  <li style="font-family:bahnschrift;"><strong>Melittidae:</strong> Melittidae is a small bee family, with over 200 described species in three subfamilies. The family has a limited distribution, with all described species restricted to Africa and the northern temperate zone.</li>

  <li style="font-family:bahnschrift;"><strong>Stenotritidae:</strong> The Stenotritidae is the smallest of all formally recognised bee families, with only 21 species in two genera, all of them restricted to Australia. Historically, they were generally considered to belong in the family Colletidae, but the stenotritids are presently considered their sister taxon, and deserving of family status.</li>
